##What is it about ? 

It's an exercise i did during my training at Elan Formation. 
I had to code a form with differents text fields wich can be used to order products. 
Then, i coded the cart part where all the products who has been ordered can be seen. We can also see the amount of products, the price, the pictures who has been sent and the total price of all the items.
